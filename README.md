# Car-Rental-System
The purpose of this project is to develop a system design especially for car rental business where customers can book their cars using the website.
A customer should login with a username and password. A new customer should create an account. Admin also should have an account to modify drivers and cars. There is a point-based system for regular customers. Customers can also choose to have a driver for their car. 
Customers can give their feedbacks and the admin will be able to see them in order to improve the business. Customers can also ask their queries which in turn will be answered by Admin.

# Project Modules:
Process 1:The client or the customer will log into the system by going to the website and selecting the 'Login' option. If the person is a 'first time user', then he/she will select the option 'Register’./n
Process 2:The reservation dashboard allows a client/ user to reserve a booking, cancel a booking, schedule an advance booking, give feedbacks and also ask their queries.
Process 3: During booking, after selecting the pick-up and drop off dates and the user has to choose a type of vehicle which would be available for service. The user also needs to select a type of plan with respect to the service available period, for instance single trip plan or round trip plan or outstation services.
Process 4: After the successful payment, the client is given an unique receipt number, specified in the dashboard about the upcoming booking number After providing these details, the amount is credited to the service vendor's. Therefore, this exchange marks the user as a positive customer and hence the system starts working on the execution of the service asked by the client.
Process 5: After the user has completed a successful transaction and a reservation, the user must log out or sign off. If he/she wants to access the dashboard again, then the client can reserve again with the existing login session without signing off. But after a time-out session previous users details are also present in the system.
